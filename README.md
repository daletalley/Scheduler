# Scheduler

## Description
I've created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day, 9 am - 5 pm, by modifying the starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Installation

There is no installation required, all the user must do is go to the deployed application link below.

## Usage

This project is used to create an organized schedule for a typical work day, 9 am - 5 pm. A user selects certain hours of the day to add tasks to local storage once the save button is clicked. The user can then view which hours of the day are either past/present/future based on the color-coded time blocks.
